## Hi 👋, I'm Daniel!

I'm an **AI Engineer** who believes that the best technology is invisible—it just works, beautifully and effortlessly.

With a **Ph.D. from Imperial College London** and experience spanning healthcare, travel, and fintech, I've learned that great AI isn't just about algorithms—it's about understanding people and solving problems that matter.

### What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of **cutting-edge AI and real-world impact**. Whether it's helping doctors diagnose diseases faster, saving organizations hundreds of thousands of pounds, or building systems that make people's lives easier, I love creating technology that makes a difference.

### My Approach

- **Impact First**: Every line of code should solve a real problem
- **Simplicity Wins**: Complex problems deserve elegant solutions  
- **Learn Continuously**: The field evolves daily, and so do I
- **Collaborate Openly**: The best solutions come from diverse perspectives

### Currently Building

🚀 **AI Solutions at HelpFirst** - Developing award-winning LLM applications that predict customer vulnerability and drive social impact

🔬 **Healthcare AI** - Creating patented diagnostic systems that help medical professionals make better decisions

� **Open Source** - Contributing to the ML community through tools and research

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not building AI systems, you'll find me exploring new technologies, mentoring upcoming data scientists, or diving into research papers. I believe in sharing knowledge and helping others grow in this exciting field.

### Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss AI, collaborate on interesting projects, or help solve challenging problems. Whether you're a fellow engineer, a startup founder, or someone curious about AI, I'd love to hear from you.
