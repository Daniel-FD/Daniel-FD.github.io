After years building AI systems for healthcare and LLMs, I've found my most challenging and impactful work yet: **blockchain security and compliance at Range.org**.

## The Transition to Blockchain

Moving from traditional ML to blockchain required learning entirely new paradigms:

- **Healthcare AI**: Structured data, regulated environments, batch processing
- **Blockchain ML**: Graph data, pseudonymous actors, real-time requirements

The shift wasn't just technical—it was philosophical. In blockchain, **trust is code**, and every system must be designed for adversarial environments.

## What Makes Blockchain ML Different?

### 1. Data Complexity
Traditional datasets have rows and columns. Blockchain has **transaction graphs** where:
- Nodes represent addresses (often pseudonymous)
- Edges are value transfers with complex metadata
- Patterns evolve as attackers adapt

### 2. Real-Time Requirements
Healthcare AI can process overnight. Compliance can't wait:
- **Sub-second detection** for suspicious transactions
- **Real-time blocking** of high-risk transfers
- **Continuous monitoring** across 21+ blockchains

### 3. Adversarial Environment
Unlike clinical data, blockchain actors actively try to evade detection:
- **Obfuscation techniques** like mixing services
- **Smart contract exploits** requiring protocol-specific knowledge
- **Cross-chain complexity** to hide transaction trails

## Building at Range.org

At Range, we've built ML systems that monitor **$30B+ in assets** across **730M+ transactions**. Key challenges:

### Cross-Chain Intelligence
Each blockchain speaks a different language:
- **Ethereum**: Complex smart contracts
- **Cosmos**: IBC cross-chain transfers  
- **Solana**: High-speed, low-cost transactions

Our ML models must understand all of them.

### Stablecoin Compliance
USDC transfers via CCTP require specialized monitoring:
- **Cross-chain tracking** of the same asset
- **KYT/AML compliance** across jurisdictions
- **Real-time risk scoring** for regulatory reporting

### DeFi Protocol Security
Each DeFi protocol creates new attack vectors:
- **Flash loan exploits**
- **Oracle manipulation**
- **Governance attacks**

Our models continuously learn new patterns.

## The Impact

Building blockchain security isn't just about technology—it's about **enabling trust** in decentralized systems. When we prevent a hack or detect money laundering, we're protecting not just individual users but the entire ecosystem.

## What's Next?

The blockchain space evolves daily. We're pushing the boundaries with:
- **Multi-modal AI** combining on-chain and off-chain data
- **Graph neural networks** for complex relationship analysis
- **LLM integration** for natural language compliance reporting

Every day brings new challenges, but that's what makes this work so rewarding.
