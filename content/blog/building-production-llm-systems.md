Two years building production LLM systems taught me that **research prototypes ≠ production systems**.

## The Reality Check

Our customer vulnerability prediction system started with GPT-4 for everything. Great demos, terrible production:
- Too slow (5+ seconds)
- Too expensive (£100+ per 1000 requests)  
- Unreliable at scale

## What Actually Works

### 1. Hybrid Architecture
```
Input → Fast Classifier → [High Confidence] → Response
           ↓
      [Uncertain] → LLM → Human Review → Response
```

**Result**: 80% handled by fast models, 10x cost reduction.

### 2. Treat Prompts as Code
- Version control everything
- A/B test variations systematically  
- Monitor performance continuously
- Build evaluation frameworks

### 3. Cost Engineering
- Cache common responses
- Use cheaper models for simple tasks
- Batch requests where possible
- Set strict token limits

### 4. Human-in-the-Loop
Even 92% accuracy needs human oversight for critical decisions. Flag uncertain cases, learn from edge cases.

## Key Metrics
- **Latency**: <1s for 90% of requests
- **Cost**: 10x reduction vs naive approach
- **Accuracy**: 92% with human backup
- **Uptime**: 99.9% reliability

## Takeaways

1. **Engineer for efficiency** from day one
2. **Measure everything** you can't optimize blindly
3. **Stay pragmatic** - solve the business problem
4. **Plan for scale** - costs compound quickly

Building production LLM systems is challenging but rewarding. Balance technical excellence with practical constraints.
