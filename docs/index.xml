The Blockchain Data Challenge Traditional ML models expect clean, structured data. Blockchain gives you:
Unstructured transaction graphs with complex relationships Real-time streaming data requiring sub-second processing Cross-chain complexity with different protocols and standards Pseudonymous actors making identity resolution challenging Key Technical Challenges 1. Transaction Graph Analysis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Simplified example: detecting suspicious patterns def analyze_transaction_cluster(addresses, transactions): # Build transaction graph graph = build_transaction_graph(transactions) # Apply ML clustering for risk scoring risk_scores = ml_model.</description></item><item><title>ML for Blockchain Compliance: Real-World Challenges</title><link>https://danielfiuza.com/blog/blockchain-ml-compliance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danielfiuza.com/blog/blockchain-ml-compliance/</guid><description>Building ML systems for blockchain compliance presents unique challenges that traditional fintech doesn&amp;rsquo;t face. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned monitoring $30B+ in assets at Range.org.
The Blockchain Data Challenge Unlike traditional financial data, blockchain transactions are:
Immutable but pseudonymous Real-time at massive scale Cross-chain across 21+ networks Complex with smart contract interactions Key Use Cases We&amp;rsquo;ve Solved 1. Stablecoin Compliance Monitoring Challenge: Track USDC transfers across chains for KYT/AML compliance.

The Reality Check Our customer vulnerability prediction system started with GPT-4 for everything. Great demos, terrible production:
Too slow (5+ seconds) Too expensive (£100+ per 1000 requests) Unreliable at scale What Actually Works 1. Hybrid Architecture Input → Fast Classifier → [High Confidence] → Response ↓ [Uncertain] → LLM → Human Review → Response Result: 80% handled by fast models, 10x cost reduction.</description></item><item><title>Adding Images to Your Hugo Portfolio</title><link>https://danielfiuza.com/blog/adding-images-hugo/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://danielfiuza.com/blog/adding-images-hugo/</guid><description>Adding Images to Your Hugo Portfolio Images make your portfolio and blog posts much more engaging and professional.

The Transition to Blockchain Moving from traditional ML to blockchain required learning entirely new paradigms:
Healthcare AI: Structured data, regulated environments, batch processing Blockchain ML: Graph data, pseudonymous actors, real-time requirements The shift wasn&amp;rsquo;t just technical—it was philosophical. In blockchain, trust is code, and every system must be designed for adversarial environments.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Portfolio Website</title><link>https://danielfiuza.com/portfolio/hugo-portfolio-website/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danielfiuza.com/portfolio/hugo-portfolio-website/</guid><description>I created my portfolio website using Hugo and UIKit, it serves as an online resume containing all my work.
This has been created as a theme so that others can use and adapt it.
Sections Homepage The homepage provides the basic information about you, including links to social media, skills you have, things you&amp;rsquo;ve done and your education. This page makes good use of UIKit grid and cards for organising all the information and ensuring it is responsive to work on mobile devices.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://danielfiuza.com/about/_index_new/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 May 2019 12:14:34 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://danielfiuza.com/about/_index_new/</guid><description>Daniel Fiuza Lead Data Scientist at Range.org with a PhD from Imperial College London.
