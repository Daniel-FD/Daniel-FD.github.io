The Blockchain Data Challenge Traditional ML models expect clean, structured data. Blockchain gives you:
Unstructured transaction graphs with complex relationships Real-time streaming data requiring sub-second processing Cross-chain complexity with different protocols and standards Pseudonymous actors making identity resolution challenging Key Technical Challenges 1. Transaction Graph Analysis 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 # Simplified example: detecting suspicious patterns def analyze_transaction_cluster(addresses, transactions): # Build transaction graph graph = build_transaction_graph(transactions) # Apply ML clustering for risk scoring risk_scores = ml_model.</description></item><item><title>ML for Blockchain Compliance: Real-World Challenges</title><link>https://danielfiuza.com/blog/blockchain-ml-compliance/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2025 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://danielfiuza.com/blog/blockchain-ml-compliance/</guid><description>Building ML systems for blockchain compliance presents unique challenges that traditional fintech doesn&amp;rsquo;t face. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned monitoring $30B+ in assets at Range.org.
The Blockchain Data Challenge Unlike traditional financial data, blockchain transactions are:
Immutable but pseudonymous Real-time at massive scale Cross-chain across 21+ networks Complex with smart contract interactions Key Use Cases We&amp;rsquo;ve Solved 1. Stablecoin Compliance Monitoring Challenge: Track USDC transfers across chains for KYT/AML compliance.

The Transition to Blockchain Moving from traditional ML to blockchain required learning entirely new paradigms:
Healthcare AI: Structured data, regulated environments, batch processing Blockchain ML: Graph data, pseudonymous actors, real-time requirements The shift wasn&amp;rsquo;t just technical—it was philosophical. In blockchain, trust is code, and every system must be designed for adversarial environments.</description></item></channel></rss>
